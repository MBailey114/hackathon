# Hackathon Python Project

Embark on an immersive journey through multiple rooms, each presenting unique questions and challenges, while multiple hints guide you towards unraveling the mysteries and overcoming obstacles along the way.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a Linux or macOS system.
- You have installed Python 3.x.
- You have installed the following Python packages:
  - `openai`: You can install it via pip using the command `pip install openai`.
  - `colorama`: You can install it via pip using the command `pip install colorama`.

## Setting Up the Environment

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI.

2. Add the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your environment variables by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

    Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Running the Script

To run the script, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and execute the following command:
   
    python3 main.py
    

This command will start the script, and you should see the output in your terminal.
